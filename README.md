# No Limit Minecarts

> 24w33a Fabric Mod that removes limits for gamerule `maxMinecartSpeed`

## Downloads

## Usage
### Server
> Install mod on your server/host and set gamerule maxMinecartSpeed to anything you want (in blocks per second).
### Client
> Install mod on your client (fabric api is not necessary), and you can see your vehicle speed in F3 debug HUD.

## API
> In version 1.1.0, I added an API for getting player vehicle speed in blocks per second, you can see it in [NoLimitMinecartsApi](src/main/java/ru/nosqd/nlm/api/NoLimitMinecartsApi.java)

## Why minecarts is slow when speed is max?
> I've noticed that speed of minecart kinda limited when there are no passengers.
